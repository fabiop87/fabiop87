### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Fabio.
I'm a super introverted and extremely curious person. I have a bunch of birds, a turtle, and currently work as a data analyst.
I enjoy building small apps to make my work life easierâ€”some of them are in public repos, feel free to use them as you like.

I'm also into infrastructure-related stuff, documenting processes, and creating tutorials to help my teammates.
Outside of work, I enjoy programming and gaming in my free time.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on TecSinapse
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Go and PowerBI
